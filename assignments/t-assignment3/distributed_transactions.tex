\section{Question 4: Distributed Transactions}

\subsection{1}

\subsubsection{Node 1}
Since Transaction 2 wants to get an exclusive lock on \texttt{X} it needs to wait until T1 is finished with reading \texttt{X}.

\subsubsection{Node 2}
Transaction 3 wants to write on \texttt{B} while T2 reads \texttt{B}, so has to wait until T2 is finished.

\subsubsection{Node 3}
Transaction 1 wants to write \texttt{C} and T3 reads \texttt{C}, so T1 has to wait for.

\subsection{2}
After putting all the wait for graphs together, we get the following graph.
